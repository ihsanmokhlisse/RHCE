FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is supported by all the operating systems and browsers.

It is a client-server based protocol. How FTP works 
Step 1: Client connects to server on port 21. 
Step 2: Server responds and ask for authentication. 
Step 3: Client decides weather to connect passively or actively and authenticate with credentials(user name password). 
Step 4: If it is an active connection, server opens port 20 for data transfer and gives ftp prompt after successful authentication.
Step 5: Client call for file and server initiates file transfer. Following picture shows
