Hard link:
-> mirror copy of the original file
-> These links share the common inodes
-> changes made to the original or hard linked file will reflect in other.
-> when we delte hard link nothing will happen to the other file.

* it has same inodes
* ls -l shows all the link
* removing link, just reduce the link count but doesnt affect other link
* cannot create a hard link for a directory
* even if the original file is removed, the link will show the content

Soft link:
-> is actual link to the original file
-> these links will have different inodes
-> Removing soft link doesn't affect anything but when the original file is removed, the link becomes a 'dangling' link that points to nonexistent file.
-> A Soft Link can link to a directory.
