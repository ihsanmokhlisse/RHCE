APACHE WEBSERVER CONFIGURATION:
	Apache is a remarkable piece of application software.  It is the most widely used 
Web Server application in the world with more than 50% share in the commercial web
server market. Apache is the most widely used Web Server application in Unix-like
operating systems but can be used on almost all platforms such as Windows. It is a
modular, process-based web server application that creates a new thread with each
simultaneous connection. It supports a number of features; many of them are 
compiled as separate modules and extend its core functionality, and can provide
everything from server side programming language support to authentication 
mechanism. Virtual hosting is one such feature that allows a single Apache Web
Server to serve a number of different websites. An Apache web server can host
multiple websites on the SAME server. You do not need separate server machine and
apache software for each website.
