NTP Configuration:
	Network Time Protocol (NTP) presents an unique ability for companies to synchronize the clocks of all the
systems within the company. Time synchronization is important for many reasons,When an organizationÂ’s systems
all maintain different clock times, it becomes very difficult from a troubleshooting standpoint to determine
when and under what conditions a particular event might be occurring.

	NTP provides an easy way to ensure that all systems will maintain the correct time which in turn can greatly
simplify the burden on administrators/tech support. Where this guide will differ is rather than having all of
the hosts on the network querying out to public NTP servers, one server will contact the public NTP system and
then provide time for all hosts within the local network.

Commands:
[root@server ~]#yum install -y ntp

Then go to web browser and type in the url box ----> www.pool.ntp.org/en/
Select Asia->India-> and copy these four lines
server 0.asia.pool.ntp.org
server 1.asia.pool.ntp.org
server 2.asia.pool.ntp.org
server 3.asia.pool.ntp.org

Then go to vim /etc/ntp.conf and paste there
[root@server ~]#vim /etc/ntp.conf
Insert

#please consider joining the pool---> below this line

server 0.asia.pool.ntp.org
server 1.asia.pool.ntp.org
server 2.asia.pool.ntp.org
server 3.asia.pool.ntp.org

and disable all redhat based default ntp servers by giving # sysmbol infront of it

At the last line type this,
logfile /var/log/ntp.log

:wq!



[root@server ~]#firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ntp
[root@server ~]#firewall-cmd --reload
[root@server ~]#systemctl enable ntpd
[root@server ~]#systemctl restart ntpd
[root@server ~]#systemctl status ntpd
[root@server ~]#ntpq -p
[root@server ~]#date -R

In Go to Adjust date/Time->Internet time->Change setting->enable synchronize with a Internet time server-> IP:192.168.1.9-> Update now.
Check the time and it will be synchronized with a server.
