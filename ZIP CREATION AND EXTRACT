GNU zip (also known as GZIP) is a software application with the purpose to compress files.It was originally intended to replace the compress program used in the early Unix systems  to be used in the GNU Project 

BZIP2 is an open source lossless data compression algorithm  basically, a class of data compression algorithms that makes it possible for the original data of a compressed file to be completely reconstructed from the compressed data.
